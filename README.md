# About
 One of the key challenges in development of self-driving cars is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. So, we are using TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. After building the nueral networks, self-driving cars will have the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs such as stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more. 

 ## Requirement
 Need to install GTSRB from https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news, or any other such traffic sign database.
